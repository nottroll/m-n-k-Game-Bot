# Solver for m,n,k-game

This project implements an AI which uses the negamax algorithm to solve the m,n,k-game.

The m,n,k-game is a 2-player game played on a m-by-n board where the goal is to have k-in-a-line either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player takes turns to put down their token on a free board space until a player wins or draw if all free spaces have been used.

With parameters m=3,n=3,k=3, the game is identical to tic-tac-toe.
